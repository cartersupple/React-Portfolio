# React-Portfolio

## Description 
React is now one of my favorite coding languages after I built this Portfolio website. As a web developer is is important to have a certain style that distinguishes you from the other coders in the space. The website that displays your works should be to the limit of your imagination. Its your place on the web to do so! This is not quite that yet, but after seeing some of the projects possible with react I know I will be spending a lot of time working in react.
